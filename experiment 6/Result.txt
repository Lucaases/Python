iNFRARED SPECTROSCOPY HAS LONG BEEN USED TO CHARACTERIZE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS, BUT THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS TECHNIQUE TO THE ANALYSIS OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS CONTAINING HIGHLY COMPLEX CHEMICAL COMPONENTS IS ARGUABLE. hOWEVER, RECENT ADVANCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED THE CAPACITY OF THIS TECHNIQUE IN ANALYZING VARIOUS TYPES OF BIOLOGICAL SPECIMENS. cONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS AN INCREASED NUMBER OF STUDIES INVESTIGATING THE APPLICATION OF INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY IN SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS OF VARIOUS DISEASES. tHE LACK OF HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC METHODS FOR EARLY DETECTION OF CANCER HAS WARRANTED THE SEARCH FOR NOVEL APPROACHES. bEING MORE SIMPLE, RAPID, ACCURATE, INEXPENSIVE, NON-DESTRUCTIVE AND SUITABLE
FOR AUTOMATION COMPARED TO EXISTING SCREENING, DIAGNOSIS, MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING METHODS, fOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY CAN POTENTIALLY IMPROVE CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING AND PATIENT OUTCOMES BY DETECTING BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES IN CANCER PATIENTS AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL. bESIDES THE COMMONLY ANALYZED BLOOD AND TISSUE SAMPLES, EXTRACELLULAR VESICLE-BASED METHOD HAS BEEN GAINING POPULARITY AS A NON-INVASIVE APPROACH. tHEREFORE, INFRARED SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES COULD BE A USEFUL TECHNIQUE IN THE FUTURE FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS. iN THIS REVIEW, WE DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF fOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS USING VARIOUS TYPES OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS FOR CANCER. aDDITIONALLY, THE RATIONALE AND ADVANTAGES OF USING EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES IN THE SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS FOR CANCER DIAGNOSTICS ARE DISCUSSED. fURTHERMORE, WE HIGHLIGHT THE CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS OF CLINICAL TRANSLATION OF THE TECHNIQUE FOR CANCER.
